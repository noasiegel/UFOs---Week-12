# UFO's - The Truth is Out There

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project was to use HTML, JS and CSS to create an interactive webpage that allows users to input their own search terms that will return accurate data. By using filters, users are able to input dates, cities, states, countries or shapes that will result in a dataframe reflecting the requested term.

## Results

To help Dana understand how someone might use the interactive webpage, I have provided a walkthough:

In the screenshot below, one can see how there are five options to filter the data: dates, cities, states, countries, or shapes. I have typed in "nc" for an example.

Once the user decides how they want to search for UFO data, they will see a filtered table to the right of the search boxes. Here we can see all the information collected about UFO sightings in the state of North Carolina.

If a user inputs a search term that doesn't exist, the table will simply show no data.

## Summary

One drawback of this design is that users don't know if a search term is available - for example, if one wants to know about UFO sightings in their hometown, they will only know if that city has data after searching. In this way, its a bit of a waste of time for the user and does not create a great user experience.

With that said, an improvement could be a dropdown list of all available cities (or states, countries, etc) that have data. That way, a user can know right off the bat if it is worth searching for a specific place or date.

Another improvement could be a "search" button. Right now, a user can either hit "enter" or just simply click out of the search box to return the results. This might be confusing or not intuative for some users, and adding a "search" button to return results would clear up that confusion.
